### Stock Portfolio Allocator 
<!--(/sample_page)(/pdf/sample_presentation.pdf)(http://example.com/) -->

This project focused on financial data analysis, employing statistical modeling, deep learning, quantum computing. Utilizing the yfinance library to extract the data, I used normal and LÃ©vy-stable distributions for statistical modeling of stock price movements, which were filtered using moving averages and Kalman filters. I employed deep learning implementations including LSTM and CNN models to try to predict the next price of the stocks (with no great success, as expected because of the efficient markets hypothesis). Quantum computing is explored through Qiskit, applying VQE and QAOA algorithms for portfolio optimization, but classical algorithms were also used for this purpose. This collection underscores my proficiency in deploying diverse technologies for advanced financial analytics, encompassing classical statistical approaches, cutting-edge quantum algorithms, and efficient filtering techniques.
